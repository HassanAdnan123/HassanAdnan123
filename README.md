**💻 Full Stack Engineer** | Building scalable systems and architecting solutions that drive business growth

---

I architect and develop robust backend systems that power mission-critical applications across diverse industries. While I occasionally push code here, most of my time is spent designing scalable architectures, solving complex integration challenges, and helping companies transform their digital infrastructure.

**What I do:**

  <i>"Make it work, make it right, make it fast."</i>
</p>

- Design and implement distributed systems with focus on performance, reliability, and maintainability
- Build RESTful APIs and microservices architectures that handle high-volume transactions
- Integrate complex business workflows across enterprise systems
- Develop secure, compliant solutions for regulated industries

I have a thing against bugs and performance bottlenecks—I'm always keen to hunt them down and think with scale and optimization in mind.

**Where I've made impact:**
- **Homebuilding**: Building robust contract processing systems for lot management and bid handling, optimized to process massive datasets efficiently through vertical scaling strategies
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Developing secure payment processing systems that handle transaction flows, reconciliation, and financial data integrity across multiple platforms
- **Property Management**: Building platforms that handle tenant operations, lease management, and real estate transactions at scale
- **HRMS**: Architecting enterprise solutions that automate employee lifecycle processes and optimize organizational efficiency
- **Emergency & Healthcare**: Developing mission-critical systems where response time and reliability directly impact patient outcomes and public safety
- **EduTech**: Creating scalable learning platforms that adapt to growing student bases while maintaining educational quality and engagement
- **Foreign Exchange**: Building money exchange systems with reconciliation processes and ledger management that ensure accurate transaction tracking and financial reporting
- **Banking**: Designing secure, compliant systems for regulatory screening (AML, TBAML, watchlist compliance) that process high-volume financial transactions

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
I work across the modern **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** ecosystem and enterprise **Java** frameworks, choosing the right tools for the problem at hand. On the backend, I design data models and query patterns that ensure optimal performance across SQL and NoSQL databases, often working with legacy systems that require careful integration strategies.

**What I do to kill time (when I have)?** I enjoy long walks, reliving retro games like Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario on emulators, and capturing moments through photography.
